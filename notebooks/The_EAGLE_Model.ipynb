    "# Using A Complete Physics Model\n",
    "\n",
    "It's time to dispense with these toy simulations and do something real! Luckily, this time round we don't need to generate initial conditions. SWIFT comes packaged with numerous example initial conditions we could use. From the Santa Barbara simulations, which were used to show the consistency of CDM with our Universe decades ago, to the more modern EAGLE simulation suite. We'll be using the smallest EAGLE box at low $z$ which can be found in `SWIFT/examples/EAGLE_low_z/EAGLE_6/` and running it with the SWIFT implementation of the EAGLE model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Compiling for a full model\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can dive in and run this simulation we need to again reconfigure and compile to turn on all of the extra physics we will need. Thankfully, instead of turning on each individual part of the model, SWIFT allows us to just tell it which sub-grid model we want to use at configure time. To configure with the EAGLE model simply run the following in the `SWIFT` directory.\n",
    "```\n",
    "./configure --disable-mpi --disable-compiler-warnings --disable-doxygen-doc --disable-hand-vec --with-subgrid=EAGLE-XL --with-hydro=sphenix --with-kernel=wendland-C2\n",

    "(here I've again included the Mac caveat options, but you may not need to). Now for the final time invoke `make` in the SWIFT directory, you now have an all singing all dancing version of SWIFT available in the `swift` executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've included a slightly modified parameter file for this simulation in this repository so you don't need to get the one in the `examples` folder, but we do need some extra files that the EAGLE model is dependent on. To get these navigate back to the `SWIFT-Workshop` directory and run:\n",

The former is used in the calculation of on-the-fly line-of-sight photometry in GAMA bands, the second is a file containing cooling tables that define the equation of state for the interstellar medium, and the latter is a table of elemental yields from supernovae.\n",

They'll use unbinding steps to remove unbound particles, some refine in phase space using velocity information, and others use the matter field to construct spherical overdensities, and this is just for the host halo level. Subhalos, the halos which contain galaxies, are not well described by a single linking length. Halo finders instead use other methods to identify these within host halos, some in phase space iteratively or recursively, others by finding saddle points in the density field, and as always each approach has its foibles.
